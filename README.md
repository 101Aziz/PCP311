#### Adding New Day Content

1. Open the `index.html` file
2. Find the `getDayTitle` function in the JavaScript section
3. Add a new entry for the day number and its title:
   ```javascript
   const titles = {
       3: "Airway Management",
       4: "Patient Assessment",
       5: "Trauma Management",
       // Add your new day here
       6: "Your New Title"
   };
   ```

4. Find the `getDayContent` function
5. Add a new condition for your day with the HTML content:
   ```javascript
   if (day === 3) {
       // Existing Day 3 content
   } else if (day === 6) { // Your new day number
       return `
           <h3>Your Day Title</h3>
           <p>Introduction paragraph for your day's content</p>
           
           <div class="key-point">
               <h4>1. First Key Point</h4>
               <ul>
                   <li>First bullet point</li>
                   <li>Second bullet point</li>
               </ul>
           </div>
           
           <div class="key-point">
               <h4>2. Second Key Point</h4>
               <ul>
                   <li>First bullet point</li>
                   <li>Second bullet point</li>
               </ul>
           </div>
           
           <!-- Add more key points as needed -->
       `;
   } else {
       // Default "coming soon" message
   }
   ```

#### Content Structure for Each Day

Follow this template for adding new day content:

```html
<h3>Day Title</h3>
<p>My Personal Notes â€“ Day X of PCP Skills Training</p>
<div style="background-color: #fff3cd; border-left: 4px solid #ffc107; padding: 0.5rem; margin-bottom: 1rem; font-size: 0.9rem;">
    <strong>Note:</strong> These are my personal learning notes and may not be complete or error-free. Always verify with official sources.
</div>

<div class="key-point">
    <h4>1. Key Point Title</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>First bullet point</li>
        <li>Second bullet point</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<!-- Add more key points as needed -->
```

## Tips for Managing Your Site

1. **Local testing**: Before pushing changes, open the HTML file in your browser to check that everything looks good

2. **Version control**: Keep track of your changes by making meaningful commit messages

3. **Backup**: Keep a local copy of your site in case you need to restore it

4. **Images**: If you want to add images, create an "images" folder in your repository and reference them using relative paths

5. **CSS customization**: You can modify the CSS in the `<style>` section to customize the look and feel

6. **Mobile testing**: Use browser developer tools to test how your site looks on mobile devices

## Advanced Customization

If you want to expand your site in the future, consider:

1. **Separating files**: Move CSS and JavaScript to separate files
2. **Adding search functionality**: Implement a search feature for finding content across days
3. **User authentication**: Add login functionality if you want to restrict access
4. **Interactive elements**: Add quizzes or interactive scenarios
5. **PDF downloads**: Create PDF versions of each day's content for offline study
